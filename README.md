# Personal Portfolio

## Description
This webpage's goal is to introduce future employers, fellow programmers and developers, and anyone else interested to me! The four parts of the main section are "About Me," "My Work," "My Life Outside of Programming," and "Contact Me." The header contains a picture of my enamel pin collection. The "About Me" section contains a little blurb about myself. The "My Work" section contains tiles containing my deployed development projects; so far there is only one and the smaller four are placeholders. The "My Life Outside of the Terminal" section contains pictures of activities that I enjoy in my casual life. The "Contact Me" section contains links which enable users to reachout to me via Email, GitHub, LinkedIn and Instagram. 

## Usage
Each of the links in the header share a name with a section of the main content of the webpage. Clicking on these links will take you to the content below in the main section. Each section contains content about me, my work, my recreational life and how to contact me.

To run the code, clone index.html from [my repository](https://github.com/sillytsundere/Horiseon-Solutions.git) and open the index.html file in preferred code editor. You can also open the style.css document to observe the styling done to make the webpage easily readable and simple to navigate. On this project the CSS file is largely utilized to enhance the appearance of the webpage. Viewing the index.htm file in a live browser with DevTools allows for specific inspection of the integration of HTML and CSS elements.
